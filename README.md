## Jack Hardy

I am Jack. Enthusiast. Curious. Personable. Aspiring Junior Developer.
Fortunate to stumble into coding earlier this year from a love of problem solving. Happy to have found something I love. Absolutely delighted!
Why do I like it so much?
For me it's a great balance between creativity, curiosity and problem solving. It also allows me to use my strengths of empathy & communication to work with other people to solve the problem. I appreciate design highly and value elegant and simple code. I am confident being a developer will bring the best out of me.
